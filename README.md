This is a game originally from https://github.com/YannThorimbert/Torus.
I have wanted a sailing adventure game for sometime and this seems to be a great basis for what I wish to do. It has most of the basic game mechanics around graphics
already roughed out which allows me to add functionality and modify how it works without a great deal of initial research. 

The game makes use of Numpy and Thorpy libraries for python.

As someone who owns a sailboat for many years, it is my goal to make this both a simulation and an adventure game.

The features I wish to add for now are:
2022/12/12:
- Add a monetary system: starting monies for buying a boat and outfitting it.
- Water is a limited resource aboard a boat. Port Villages and Oasis' can replenish water to full
    OR an option is to have a watermaker onboard. 100gal water tank is the largest. Water usage is 1 gal/crew member/day.
- Fuel is a limited resource aboard a boat. Can refuel at a village. 100gal tank, fuel usage is 0.9gal a day
- Battery Power is a limited resource on a boat. Can charge with the engine (which costs fuel), or docked at a village
- Move NW, NE, SE, SW
